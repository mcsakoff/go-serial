Package *serial* provides a simple, high-level, system-independent
interface for accessing asynchronous serial ports.

It provides functions and methods for opening serial ports,
configuring their basic parameters (baudrate, character format,
flow-control, etc.), for reading and writing data from and to them,
and for a few other miscellaneous operations (e.g. sending a break
signal, flushing the I/O buffers).

Data transfer operations support deadlines (timeouts)
and safe cancelation; a blocked read or write operation can be
safely and reliably canceled from another goroutine by closing the
port.

###Supported systems

Most unix-like systems are supported.

Package *serial* uses package
[termios](https://github.com/npat-efault/serial#termios) to
supports systems that provide the POSIX Terminal Interface for
configuring terminal devices.

For data-transfer operations (Read, Write) it uses package
[poller](https://github.com/npat-efault/poller), which provides I/O
operations with timeouts and safe cancelation.

Depending on the specific system, both of these packages (*termios*
and *poller*) can be compiled either to use CGo, or as pure-Go
packages. See their documentation for details.

Addition of support for other systems is certainly possible, and
mostly welcome. *Patches and pull requests for this will be greatly
appreciated.*

#termios [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/npat-efault/serial/termios?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/npat-efault/serial/termios)

Package *termios* is a simple Go wrapper to the
[POSIX Terminal Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_terminal_interface)
(POSIX Termios).

Package *termios* is more low-level and system-specific than package
[serial](https://github.com/npat-efault/serial) and can be used to
configure most aspects of a terminal device's operation on systems
that support POSIX Termios.

###Supported systems

Package *termios* should work on all systems that support the POSIX
terminal interface, that is, on most Unix-like systems.  Depending on
the system, package *termios* can either be built to use the system's
LIBC functions and macros through CGo, or as a pure-go package that
issues system calls directly. In either case, the API presented by the
package is identical.

By default package *termios* is built to use CGo to access the
system's LIBC termios functions and macros. This is the most portable
option. If building *termios* fails on a system that has POSIX termios
support, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/npat-efault/serial/issues), or
submit a patch to make it work (the required changes will most likely
be trivial).

Alternatively, you can build package *termios* as a *pure-Go* package
that issues system-calls directly. To do this define the `nocgo`
build-tag when building/installing the package, like this:

```shell
cd $GOPATH/github.com/npat-efault/serial/termios
go install -tags 'nocgo'
```

Building *termios* as a pure-Go package is *not* supported on all
systems.
